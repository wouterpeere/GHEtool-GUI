# Functionalities of GHEtool

GHEtool has a couple of different functionalities, all centered around borefield sizing.
In the examples listed below, one can find example code on how to use the different functionalities.

Sizing the borefield (i.e. calculating the required depth) for a given injection and extraction load for the borefield (three sizing methods are available).

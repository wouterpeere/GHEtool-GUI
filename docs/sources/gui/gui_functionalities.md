# Functionalities of the Graphical User Interface

Besides the code version of GHEtool, a graphical user interface (built with [ScenarioGUI](https://github.com/tblanke/ScenarioGUI)) is also available.
The functionalities, currently included in the graphical version of GHEtool are:

- comparing multiple scenario's next to eachother
- plotting the temperature profile
	- monthly resolution
	- hourly resolution
- sizing a borefield
	- with a constant ground temperature or with a thermal gradient
	- with/without a dynamically calculated borehole equivalent resistance
	- three different sizing methodologies (ranging from monthly based (L2/L3) to hourly resolution)
- calculating the percentage of a thermal load that can be put on an existing borefield
